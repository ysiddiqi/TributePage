                <p>It is a curious fact that Stephen William Hawking was born on 8th January 1942, exactly 300 years
                    after the death of the Italian astronomer, Galileo Galilei. Perhaps it seems a fitting symmetry.
                    Often referred to as ‘the father of observational astronomy,’ Galileo was one of Stephen’s
                    inspirations during his long career as a theoretical physicist and cosmologist.
                    Stephen was born in Oxford during WWII, the eldest of four children to parents Dr Frank Hawking and
                    Eileen Isobel Hawking. With his siblings, Stephen had a happy childhood mostly spent in Highgate,
                    London and then in St. Albans, Hertfordshire. Stephen admitted to being a late developer and
                    recalled that he was never more than halfway up the class. </p>

        <div class="column">
            <p>Somewhat reluctantly, Stephen agreed to apply to his father’s college, University College, Oxford.
                Stephen wanted to read mathematics but his father, tropical medicine specialist Dr Frank Hawking, was
                adamant that there would be no jobs for mathematicians and Stephen should read medicine. They
                compromised on Natural Sciences and Stephen went up to Oxford at the young age of 17 in 1959. Despite
                claiming to do very little work, Stephen performed well enough in his written examinations to be called
                for a ‘viva’ (an interview) to determine which class of degree he should receive. Stephen told the
                examiners that if they awarded him a first-class degree he would leave Oxford and go to Cambridge but if
                he got a second, he would stay in Oxford. They duly gave him a first, as of course, he hoped they would.
                Stephen went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1962. </p>

            <p>n 1988 Hawking catapulted to international prominence with the publication of A Brief History of Time.
                The short, informative book became an account of cosmology for the masses and offered an overview of
                space and time, the existence of God and the future. </p>

            <p>Hawking had a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neuron disease (MND; also known as
                amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that
                results in the death of motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over
                decades.

                Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some
                stairs and difficulties when rowing. The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly slurred and
                his family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas, and medical investigations were
                begun. The MND diagnosis came when Hawking was 21, in 1963. At the time, doctors gave him a life
                expectancy of two years.</p>
